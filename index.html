    Biography
</h1>
<p>
    I chose to become a game designer when I was choosing a major for my first year of college. I have always been enthusiactic about games as a medium for storytelling and have researched the topic extensively. I wanted to challenge myself by joining GIMM, (games, interactive, media, and mobile) to see if I had what it takes to realize my own ideas and ambitions.
    </p>
    <p>
        Turns out that I do have what it takes! I've been learning and absorbing all different avenues of the tech industry, like web development, adobe products, modeling, physical computing, and Unity. I understand all the different parts that go into creating a game and how to properly manage a team to achieve that final product. 
        <p>
            I specifically enjoy the design aspects of creating a game. Storyboarding, game mechanics, and art design being my favorite parts to work on.
        </p>
        <p>
            This website is to give a futher glance into my achievements so far, and to be a point of reference in the future to see how much I will have grown.
